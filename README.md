Stack is a beautiful and flexible key-value based note editor which helps you to organize your notes, ideas, links, todos, images, videos and much more, all in one place.
Imagine your notebook and a smart app which helps you to be more productive, have a baby.

With Stack, you can add new notes on top of the stack blazingly fast. If they are a bit more important just give them a key and find them easily when you need them.

You can use Stack as a writer, but in the first place it's made for your various (sometimes unrelated) notes, ideas, links, images, videos and much more. So to say all things which are worth saving.

The core of Stack are the keys. It's a great way to group your ideas and categorize your thoughts. You can add them to notes on the fly and compose & filter your notes later.
